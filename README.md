# biopolymer-recipe
A biopolymer intended (initially) as a replacement for PVC (plastisol) in the creation of soft plastic fishing baits.

## Abstract
The composition and manufacture of a biodegradable, edible, soft fishing bait that is both commercially viable and accessible to the home hobbyist, that is digestible, compostable, will breakdown in the water system, and reduce harm to the fish and ecosystem is being investigated. The composition should be sufficiently durable, be easily stored and handled by anglers onshore and offshore, be sufficiently heat tolerant and stand up to reasonable use in water. The manufacturing process should be such that both commercial operations and hobbyist can create baits with ease, using typical injection and hand pouring methods.

#### Background
Since their introduction in the 1950's, soft plastic baits made from PVC have dominated the fishing industry. In a survey released in 2013, the the U.S. recreational fishing industry generated [$47.7 billion in retail sales](https://asafishing.org/uploads/2011_ASASportfishing_in_America_Report_January_2013.pdf "American Sportfishing Association Report") for all types of fishing, and if PVC baits are the dominant lure used in sprt fishing, one can only imagine how many tons of PVC plastic is deposited into the environment, and landfill each year. As every angler knows, soft plastic baits wear out quickly with use, often times needing to be replaced with each caught fish, or ultimately being lost to snags, being bitten off or simply falling off the hook. Furthermore, PVC baits will go stale over time, if not stored properly, leading to many baits being diverted to landfill after each season ends.

With the cost of the average 10 count bag of PVC baits ranging from $5 to $10 (50¢ - $1 per bait), and the average bag of baits lasting for 1 or two outings, the accumulative cost for the avid angler can reach upwards of $500/year. 

Soft plastic baits are made of plastisol, a suspension of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in a liquid plasticizer. The process of making PVC-based soft baits is dangerous, with the fumes of the PVC heated to 300°F being toxic, and the risks of personal injury when handling molten plastics for the purpose of hand-injection into heated bait molds. The hobbyist bait maker cannot simply create his own plastisol from home ingredients and setup required to use manufactured plastisol (proper ventalation and protective gear) makes the barrier to entry high.
